## Introduction
The availability of new Oracle Golden Gate 23c free has been announced, which takes advantage of the new GoldenGate Microservice 23.3 as its primary engine.

Oracle GoldenGate 23c Free is the same robust Oracle GoldenGate on which enterprises worldwide rely. It provides a complete experience and is packaged for user-friendliness and straightforward downloadâ€”for free.

GoldenGate Free offers built-in support for low-latency replication, modern data types, microservices, and all the top-tier GoldenGate features, all in a single, user-friendly, easy to setup free application.

In addition to the previously available uni-direction replication from earlier releases, this most recent version of GoldenGate 23c adds support for Oracle Database 23c and introduces a completely new, significantly simplified user interface for configuring multi-active data replication with Automatic Conflict Detection and Resolution (ACDR).

GoldenGate Free is completely free, and its pre-built container is simple to acquire from the Oracle Container Registry, and the container can run on environments such as Podman, Rancher, or Docker.
